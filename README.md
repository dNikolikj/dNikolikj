## 👋 Hi, I’m Darko Nikolikj

Full-stack software engineer with a strong focus on building clear, maintainable, and scalable systems.  
I enjoy working across backend, frontend, and cloud — especially where systems, people, and processes meet.

Most of my recent work has been in **enterprise platforms** (logistics, data automation, cloud-native systems), while continuously sharpening fundamentals and learning new tools along the way.

### ⚙️ Backend
- .NET • C#
- REST • GraphQL
- MS SQL Server • MongoDB Atlas
- Entity Framework Core

### 🖥️ Frontend
- Angular • React
- PrimeNG • Nx
- Micro-frontends

### ☁️ Cloud & DevOps
- Microsoft Azure
- CI/CD pipelines
- Infrastructure-aware development
- Azure DevOps

## 🏗️ Architecture & Design

I’ve worked with and applied common architectural and design patterns in real projects, including:

- **Onion Architecture** – promoting separation of concerns and testability  
- **N-Tier Architecture** – structuring applications with clear responsibility boundaries  
- **Repository Pattern** – abstracting data access for cleaner domain logic  
- **Mediator Pattern** – reducing coupling between components  

I value pragmatism over dogma — patterns are tools, not goals.

## 📚 Learning & Reading

I use GitHub not only to store code, but also to **track my learning journey**.  
Some books that have shaped how I think about software:

- *The Pragmatic Programmer* — Andrew Hunt & David Thomas  
- *Clean Code* / *The Clean Coder* — Robert C. Martin  
- *C# in Depth* — Jon Skeet  
- *The Art of Unit Testing* — Roy Osherove  
- *Growing Object-Oriented Software, Guided by Tests* — Freeman & Pryce  
- *Test-Driven Development: By Example* — Kent Beck  
- *Unit Testing: Principles, Practices, and Patterns* — Vladimir Khorikov  
- *HTTP/2 in Action* — Barry Pollard  

Always reading, always refining.

## 🧪 Projects & Practice

This profile includes a mix of **learning projects**, **experiments**, and **practice applications** built over time.  
They reflect how I explore new ideas, reinforce fundamentals, and test concepts before applying them in larger systems.

Examples include:
- Productivity and task-management applications
- JavaScript-based applications (maps, banking simulations, UI-heavy apps)
- Learning Management System features
- Backend-focused projects using .NET, EF Core, and REST APIs
- UI-focused projects emphasizing responsive design and usability

Some projects are public, others are private — all are part of continuous growth.

## 🎯 How I approach engineering

- Prefer clarity over cleverness  
- Care about how systems evolve, not just how they start  
- Enjoy collaboration and learning from more experienced engineers  
- Believe good software is built through communication as much as code
